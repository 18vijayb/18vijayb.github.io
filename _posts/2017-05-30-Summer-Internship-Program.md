I worked at UC Santa Cruz in the Biomedical Sciences Laboratory as part of the Summer Internship Program. Two other interns and I investigated the presence of Toxoplasama Gondii in cat colonies in Northern California. As part of the internship, we took samples at each site, cleaned them, and processed them in the lab. We analyzed the results using the language R.
