For my 2019 summer internship, I worked at the UPS Air Group Building in Louisville, Kentucky. A team of me and five other interns worked in scrum agile development using Spring Boot, Microsoft SQL, and Angular to develop applications. My main goal for this internship was to learn as much as I could about software engineering in the corporate world. I took part in a hackathon with my team as well. By the end of the internship, my group and I presented our work to an audience of UPS workers and fellow interns.
