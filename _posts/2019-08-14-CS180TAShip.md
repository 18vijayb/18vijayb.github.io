title: Teaching Assistantship for CS 18000 - Object Oriented Programming

During the Fall semester 2019, I worked as an undergraduate teaching assistant for the introductory computer science class for CS majors.

My roles included proctoring exams and lab sessions, as well as answering student questions on Piazza.

Building off my experience as a teaching assistant for CS 177, I worked individually with students to clarify concepts explained in lecture and answer questions peratining to the lab.

I've explained syntatic parts of java, like case statements and GUI's, to complex aspects of languages, including syncrhonization, and the four pillars of object-oriented programming (Abstraction, Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism).
