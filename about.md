My name is Vijay Bharadwaj. I am a third-year computer science and mathematics/statistics student planning to graduate in Fall 2021.

Currently I work as a research assistant in the Kihara Lab for Dr. Kihara.

My current coursework includes the following:

* CS 38100: Algorithms
* CS 25200: Systems Programming
* CS 37300: Data Mining and Machine Learning
* MA 34100: Real Analysis
* EAPS 32700: Climate, Science, and Society

I love participating in hackathons and programming competitions, as well as working on personal coding projects.

Some other activities I enjoy in my spare time include reading, flying my drone, playing video games, and spending time with my friends.

Next summer, I will be working at [Clever](https://www.clever.com) in San Francisco as part of their SDE internship program.
