My name is Vijay Bharadwaj. I am a second-year computer science and mathematics/statistics student planning to graduate in Spring 2021.

Currently, I work as teaching assistant and developer for CS 24000 - Programming in C. I also work as a research assistant in the Kihara Lab for Dr. Kihara.

My current coursework includes the following:

* STAT 41700: Statistical Theory 
* CS 25100: Data Structures
* CS 25000: Computer Architecture
* MA 35300: Linear Algebra II
* CS 39000: Competitive Programming II
* ENGL 42000: Business Writing

I love participating in hackathons and programming competitions, as well as working on personal coding projects.

Some other activities I enjoy in my spare time include photography, flying my drone, playing video games, and spending time with my friends.

Next summer, I will be working at Amazon in Seattle as part of their SDE internship program.
